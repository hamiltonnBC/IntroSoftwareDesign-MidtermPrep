# IntroSoftwareDesign-MidtermPrep

## Overview
This GitHub repository serves as a practice midterm study guide for students enrolled in an Introduction to Software Design class. It features a variety of Python exercises designed to reinforce essential programming concepts, with a particular focus on using the Turtle graphics library to visualize these concepts.

## Purpose
The main goals of this repository are to:
1. Provide hands-on practice with fundamental programming concepts
2. Offer visual representations of code execution using Turtle graphics
3. Supplement other studying strategies for midterm preparation

## Contents
This repository includes exercises covering:
- Data types
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- Loops (for and while)
- Functions and parameter passing
- Basic Turtle graphics commands

## Key Features
- **Turtle-based Exercises**: Many exercises use the Turtle library to provide visual feedback, making abstract concepts more concrete.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Exercises range from basic to more complex, allowing students to build their skills gradually.
- **Practical Applications**: Each exercise aims to demonstrate real-world applications of programming concepts.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Python files in your preferred IDE or text editor.
3. Read the comments and TODO sections in each file for instructions.
4. Complete the exercises, run the code, and observe the Turtle graphics output.
5. Compare your solutions with the provided completed versions (if available).

## Note to Students
This study guide is not comprehensive and is meant to supplement your other studying strategies. Make sure to also review class notes, textbooks, and other resources provided by your instructor.
